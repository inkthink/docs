## Configuring your ErgoDox


### Installing a configuration

a.k.a. flashing the firmware

First, make sure:

* Your keyboard is plugged in
* You know what the "Teensy reset button" is ([the tiny hole in the upper right](tiny_reset_button.jpg)). Alternatively, you can use the "teensy" key if it's in your keymap.
* Download the [firmware.eep](firmware.eep) from this repository

Then:

1. Download and run the [Teensy Loader app](http://www.pjrc.com/teensy/loader.html)
2. Press and release the Teensy reset button
3. Click the "Auto" button on the upper right hand side of the Teensy-Loader window
4. Drag and drop the '.eep' file onto the Teensy loader window. 
5. Drag and drop the '.hex' file onto the Teensy loader window.
6. Press and release the Teensy reset button

Notes:

* If this process fails in the "Auto" button stage, try dragging in a .eep and a .hex file, then pressing auto and restarting the process from the beginning.
* For a more detailed account, check out the [ergodox-firmware repository](https://github.com/benblazak/ergodox-firmware#load-firmware-onto-the-teensy)

### Keyboard configuration tools

- [keyboard-configurator from massdrop](https://keyboard-configurator.massdrop.com/ext/ergodox)
    - Works and looks good *check the comments on that page for information about special keys, like hold-key-for-layer and media keys*
    - Isn't open source. Doesn't provide all options.
- [fusion](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/fusion)
    - Open source. Work in progress. Will and be useable soon!

### Existing configurations

[Look at the list of existing configurations on the wiki](https://github.com/ErgoDox-EZ/docs/wiki/Existing-configurations)



### Write/update your own configuration (in c!)

This requires a little bit of familiarity with coding.

1. Go to [github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware) and read the Readme at the base of the repository, top to bottom.
2. Follow the instructions for [ergodox_ez configuration](https://github.com/jackhumbert/qmk_firmware/tree/master/keyboard/ergodox_ez)
3. Create a repository to track your configuration and [add it to this readme](#existing-configurations)
